# Full Stack Coding Challenge

This challenge enables us to glance at your expertise at full stack development.

## Requirments
In the data folder you will find a file named "sampleData.csv". It contains sample data from our system. As this data comes in realtime when in production, we want you to :
1. Read the data from the file.
2. Display the data on a webpage, line by line. You need to also add ability to filters to the data around the CSV columns (i.e joints). Please Note: No wireframe for the UI is provided, we want to see your imagination and implementation.
3. Write this data to a database. Please note that you need to write this data in realtime as (for this example, consider) it is processed and lost.
4. Use Python Fast API for backend. You may use whatever framework you want for frontend.

You may use whatever framework you please.

Once done, you may zip the project and email to "abdullah@movrs.com".
